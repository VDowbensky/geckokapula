# Circuit and PCB design for hardware version 2.2

The PCB is designed so that all SMD components can be placed by
[JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/).

Tutorials for ordering:
* [How to generate Gerber and Drill files in KiCad 7](https://jlcpcb.com/help/article/362-how-to-generate-gerber-and-drill-files-in-kicad-7)
* [How to generate the BOM and Centroid file from KiCAD](https://jlcpcb.com/help/article/81-How-to-generate-the-BOM-and-Centroid-file-from-KiCAD)

Make sure each component gets placed in the right orientation.
Pin 1 of each IC is marked with a dot on the silkscreen.
